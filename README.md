# Project Overview

This project leverages lightweight Kubernetes and automation tools to simplify development, testing, and deployment. Below are brief explanations of the core technologies used.

## 📌 Technologies Explained

### 🐳 K3s: Lightweight Kubernetes
[K3s](https://k3s.io/) is a lightweight, fully compliant Kubernetes distribution designed for edge computing, IoT, and CI/CD environments. It simplifies Kubernetes by reducing dependencies and optimizing resource usage, making it ideal for development and small-scale production.

### 📦 Vagrant: Virtual Machine Automation
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a tool for managing virtual machines in a repeatable and automated way. It allows developers to create, configure, and share development environments using a simple configuration file (`Vagrantfile`), making it easy to ensure consistency across different machines.

### 🚀 K3d: Kubernetes in Docker
[K3d](https://k3d.io/) is a lightweight wrapper for running K3s inside Docker. It enables fast and simple local Kubernetes cluster deployment without the need for a full virtual machine, making it a great tool for testing Kubernetes-based applications.

### 🔄 Continuous Integration (CI) & Argo CD
- **Continuous Integration (CI)** is a DevOps practice where code changes are automatically tested and integrated into the main branch using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD. This helps detect issues early and speeds up development.
- **Argo CD** is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It monitors Git repositories for configuration changes and automatically synchronizes them with the Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that deployments stay consistent with the desired state.
